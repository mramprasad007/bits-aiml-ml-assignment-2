# ML Assignment 2 - Breast Cancer Classification

## Problem Statement
The goal is to classify breast cancer tumors as either **Malignant** or **Benign** based on cell measurements derived from fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
- **Features:** 30 numeric features
- **Instances:** 569 samples
- **Target:** Binary (Malignant vs Benign)
